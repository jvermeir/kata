After reading Uncle Bob's Clean Coder book, I decided to follow his advice to practice coding by solving simple problems over and over again. The idea is to solve the same problem and become ever better because solutions become part of muscle memory. 

To get started I copied a tool I made to organize a few thousand photo's on my phone. 

The validate directory contains a small test utility. Each solution should create a directory structure validate/target. After running the solution code, cd into the validate folder and run

```
python acceptanceTest.py 
```

to check the result. 

## TODO

1. C64/6510 assembly (because that was the first programming language I learned)
2. Some fancy machine learning algorithm
3. C++
4. C
5. Lisp
6. Prolog
7. Erlang
8. TLA+

Well, 6510 assembly language was a bit of a struggle, so I've parked that one for now. I did add a web interface to my Java version and thought that would also be a nice experiment: how do you implement a simple JSON over HTTP interface in each language?
